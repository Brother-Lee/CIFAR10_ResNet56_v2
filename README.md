# ResNet_v2
A simple yet accurate Tensorflow re-implementation of paper 'Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks'. 

Achieve 93.37% val accuracy in CIFAR10, which is nearly the same as He's paper.

The pre_trained model would be shared later.

The scripts' structure is simple and easy to read, especially for a tensorflow-beginner.
